      <h4>🌿 About Our Gram Panchayat – Saringpur</h4>
      <p>
        
        Saringpur Gram Panchayat is a vibrant and evolving local government body situated in the heart of rural India.
        Serving as the administrative backbone for five villages – Saringpur, Mahraur, Takia-Pe, Kanera, and Sahpurwa –
        this Panchayat plays a vital role in driving development, ensuring governance, and uplifting the lives of its
        people.
      </p>
      <h4>🌾 The Spirit of Rural Unity</h4>
      <p>
        
        The five villages under Saringpur Panchayat are not just geographically connected, but also culturally united.
        Each village brings its own traditions, strengths, and contributions, making the Panchayat a collective force of
        rural progress. From the lush green fields of Mahraur to the vibrant community gatherings of Kanera, the unity
        and cooperation among these villages set a strong foundation for inclusive growth.
      </p>
      <h4>🏛 What the Panchayat Does</h4>
      <p>
        
        Our Gram Panchayat is responsible for managing basic services like:

        Clean water and sanitation

        Primary health care and nutrition

        Rural road and street light maintenance

        School education and scholarship distribution

        Managing local disputes through Panchayat meetings

        Organizing welfare schemes like PM Awas Yojana, NREGA, and Old Age Pension

        The Panchayat also plays a pivotal role during emergencies, such as natural disasters or public health
        outbreaks, ensuring timely support and resources reach every family.
      </p>
      <h4>📊 Transparency and Budget Allocation</h4>
      <p>
        
        Every year, the Gram Panchayat holds a Gram Sabha where the community is informed about passed budgets, upcoming
        development works, and pending approvals. The transparency in fund allocation and use builds trust among
        villagers and encourages active participation in decision-making.
